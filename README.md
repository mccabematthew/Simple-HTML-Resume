# A Simple Resume

Description:
This project consists of a html file, CSS file, and a json file that were 
utilized in order to create a simple resume. I created this project by following 
a github repo for open-source learning projects by **Microsoft**.

## What I learned:
Through this project, I learned how to
- better use VS Code and how to use a json plugin called codeswing that 
allowed me to use my browser withing VS Code to have a live view of the 
changes that I made. 
- I also learned how to use the web IDE to make live changes to my web projects! 
- I also learned a bit about styling with CSS and the importance of resume readability.
