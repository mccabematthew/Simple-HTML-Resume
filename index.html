					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<!-- about you -->
                    <p>I am currently beginning my sophomore year
					and am now co-enrolled at Northeast Lakeview College 
					and TAMU. I am working towards an AS in Engineering, and a BS
					in Computer Engineering. I am currently working as a 
					mobile application development intern using flutter and 
					dart, and I am always looking for opportunities to apply 
					my software engineering skills. I am looking for an 
					internship for the coming winter, and an internship for 
					next summer.
